# coulombs law 
* statement:
            `coulombs law is a experimental law which calculate the amount of force between two electircally charged perticals at rest `
* the forces between the ` q1 & q2 ` are called the electrostatic force or coulombs force
*  the charge is represented by ` q `
* the law statement , ` the magnitude, or absolute value, of the attractive or repulsive electrostatic force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of their charges and inversely proportional to the squared distance between them `

# electrical field 
* an electric field is basically the field area through which a charge have the ability to attract or repal another charged partical
* the concept of magetic and electric field is quite similar but the do differ in some aspests
# how electric field works
* to understand the phenomena of the electric field, first we have to understand what is a charge
## charge 
* a charge is the charge is:`a fundamental property of matter that determines how it interacts with electric and magnetic fields. There are two types of charge: positive and negative`
* the value of charge is `1.602×10−19 coulombs.` it is denoted by `q`
* charges are conserved means they can't be `created nor destoryed`
* they can only be `transferred from one object to another.`
## So the question arises how such a small object can emit such fields of attraction and repulsion?
* for that we have to understand the nature of charge
# nature of charges
* the charges are `negative (-) ,positive (+)`
* the positive charge `emits the fields rays outwards`
* the negative charge is opposite to of positive chrage
* the negative charge fields are `direction inwards` or towards the charge
# how they act when brought together!!
* the nature of both charges is different and their ability of attraction and repulsion as well
* the basic concept of how there forces are brought together are exactly based on their nature of emittion 
## Explanation
* The relationship between charges and electric fields is fundamental in electromagnetism. Charges create electric fields, which are regions of influence that emanate from charged particles into the surrounding space. Electric field lines move away from positive charges and towards negative ones. The electric field represents the force experienced by a unit charge placed in the vicinity of charged particles
* illustrate the relationship between charges and electric fields, consider a simple scenario with two oppositely charged balls: a small, positively charged ball and a larger, negatively charged ball. As these balls come closer to each other, their electric fields begin to overlap and interact. The electric field lines radiate outward from the positively charged ball and converge toward the negatively charged ball. In this case, the electric field strength increases as you get closer to either ball because the force acting upon a hypothetical positive test charge would grow stronger.
## what is test charge??
* A test charge is a point charge used to investigate the electric or magnetic fields in physics.
* Test charges play a crucial role in understanding and quantifying electric fields, allowing for the investigation of how charges interact and influence each other within a given space.
## Examples of utilizing test charges to understand electric fields include:

1. **Point charge in uniform electric field**: Imagine a single positive test charge placed in a uniform electric field caused by other charges. The test charge experiences a constant force in the direction of the electric field lines, enabling us to determine the electric field strength and direction.

2. **Charged spheres**: Consider two identical spheres, initially holding equal amounts of positive and negative charges. When one sphere acquires an additional positive charge by coming into proximity with a charged object, the negative charge on the other sphere moves towards the positively charged sphere, creating an imbalance of charges and an electric field between the spheres.

3. **Rubbed glass and silk**: Glass rubbed with silk gains a positive charge, while the silk obtains a negative charge. Separation of the glass and silk leads to an attractive force between them, as the positive and negative charges seek to recombine, forming an electric field.

These examples demonstrate how test charges help us analyze and visualize electric fields, thereby deepening our understanding of the relationships among charges, electric fields, and forces.

 # Electric flux
 * `Electric flux quantifies the electric field passing through a given surface, regardless of its size or shape.`
 * Electric flux is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism that measures the electric field passing through a given surface. It is defined as the dot product of the electric field and the area vector, representing the number of electric field lines crossing a surface. The electric flux through a surface is directly proportional to the total number of electric field lines passing through it.
