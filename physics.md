# coulombs law 
* statement:
            `coulombs law is a experimental law which calculate the amount of force between two electircally charged perticals at rest `
* the forces between the ` q1 & q2 ` are called the electrostatic force or coulombs force
*  the charge is represented by ` q `
* the law statement , ` the magnitude, or absolute value, of the attractive or repulsive electrostatic force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of their charges and inversely proportional to the squared distance between them `

# electrical field 
* an electric field is basically the field area through which a charge have the ability to attract or repal another charged partical
* the concept of magetic and electric field is quite similar but the do differ in some aspests
# how electric field works
* to understand the phenomena of the electric field, first we have to understand what is a charge
## charge 
* a charge is the charge is:`a fundamental property of matter that determines how it interacts with electric and magnetic fields. There are two types of charge: positive and negative`
* the value of charge is `1.602×10−19 coulombs.` it is denoted by `q`
* charges are conserved means they can't be `created nor destoryed`
* they can only be `transferred from one object to another.`
## So the question arises how such a small object can emit such fields of attraction and repulsion?
* for that we have to understand the nature of charge
# nature of charges
* the charges are `negative (-) ,positive (+)`
* the positive charge `emits the fields rays outwards`
* the negative charge is opposite to of positive chrage
* the negative charge fields are `direction inwards` or towards the charge
# how they act when brought together!!
* the nature of both charges is different and their ability of attraction and repulsion as well
* the basic concept of how there forces are brought together are exactly based on their nature of emittion
