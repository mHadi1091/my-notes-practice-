# coulombs law 
* statement:
            `coulombs law is a experimental law which calculate the amount of force between two electircally charged perticals at rest `
* the forces between the ` q1 & q2 ` are called the electrostatic force or coulombs force
*  the charge is represented by ` q `
* the law statement , ` the magnitude, or absolute value, of the attractive or repulsive electrostatic force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of their charges and inversely proportional to the squared distance between them `
