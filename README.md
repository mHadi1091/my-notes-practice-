fundamentals of programmings 

intro to c++
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello world!";

    return 0;
}

basic fundamental of c++ is that all the code open with the code of [int main(){ ]
the code systems runs on 2 fundamentals known as input and output

output displays results or can be use to send data to other system
class practiced code ;
#include <iostream>
int main(){
using namespace std;
cout<<"hello world";
return 0;
}
using namespace std; is use as a one time string which allows to run the code properly 
the folllowing input code will show the result in the output as shown in the string for example [hello world] 

create a output code to know your age 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int a;
    cout<<"what is your age:";
    cin>>a;
    cout<<"your age is:"<<a;
    return 0;
}
