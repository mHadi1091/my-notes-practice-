# introduction to computers üñ•Ô∏è
* Computer is an electronic device, which accepts the data and
instructions (input) from the user, process the data according to
the instructions and gives the result (output).

## Characteristics of compuetrs üñ•Ô∏è
* the characteristices of a computer are based on few things given below:
* ` speed `
* ` accuracy `
* ` storage `
* ` powwer of remembering `
* ` Versatility`
* ` No I Q (Intelligence Quotient)`
* ` reliability `
* ` communication `

 * COTS (commerical off-the-shelf) vs custom build software

  # types of computers 
  * `micro computers`: A microcomputer is a small computer typically equipped with a microprocessor, especially known as a personal computer. These devices are compact and commonly used for personal or small-scale computing tasks.
* `mini computers`: A minicomputer is a type of computer that retains most features and capabilities of a large computer but is smaller in physical size, offering a balance between mainframes and personal computers.
* `main computers`: A mainframe computer, also known as a mainframe or big iron, is a powerful computer primarily utilized by large organizations for critical applications such as bulk data processing, industry statistics, enterprise resource planning, and transaction processing. Mainframes are distinguished by their significant processing power, larger size than personal computers, and capability to handle very high volumes of input and output. These computers are designed to support multiple users simultaneously and are often used as servers in data centers.

# cots vs custom softwares 
Certainly! Here's a comparison of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solutions versus custom-built solutions, along with their pros and cons:

**Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Solutions:**
## COTS stands for "Commercial Off-The-Shelf." It refers to software or hardware products that are ready-made and available for purchase from third-party vendors, rather than being developed in-house. These products are designed to be used as-is or with minimal customization to fulfill common business or organizational needs.

Pros:
1. **Cost-Effective**: Generally, COTS solutions are cheaper upfront because the development costs are spread across multiple users.
2. **Time-Saving**: COTS products are readily available, saving time on development and implementation.
3. **Proven Reliability**: Since COTS solutions are already in use by various customers, they often have a proven track record of reliability and performance.
4. **Vendor Support**: Typically, COTS solutions come with vendor support, including maintenance, updates, and technical assistance.
5. **Feature-Rich**: COTS products often come with a wide range of features and functionalities, meeting the needs of many users out of the box.

Cons:
1. **Limited Customization**: COTS solutions may not perfectly fit the unique requirements of every user, leading to limitations in customization.
2. **Vendor Dependency**: Users rely on the vendor for updates, bug fixes, and support, which can lead to issues if the vendor discontinues the product or provides inadequate support.
3. **Potential for Bloatware**: COTS solutions may include unnecessary features or components (bloatware) that increase complexity and resource usage.
4. **Security Risks**: Since COTS products are widely used, they can be targeted by cyber attackers, and vulnerabilities may take time to be addressed by the vendor.
5. **Licensing Restrictions**: Some COTS products come with licensing restrictions, such as limitations on the number of users or devices.

**Custom-Built Solutions:**
## Custom-built solutions are software or hardware products that are specifically developed to meet the unique requirements and specifications of a particular individual, organization, or project. These solutions are designed and built from scratch, allowing for maximum customization and tailoring to address specific needs, workflows, and preferences. Custom-built solutions are often developed by internal or external teams of developers, engineers, or designers, and they can range from software applications to complex hardware systems.

Pros:
1. **Tailored to Specific Needs**: Custom-built solutions can be designed and developed to precisely match the unique requirements of the user, maximizing efficiency and effectiveness.
2. **Greater Control**: Users have full control over the development process, including the choice of technologies, architecture, and features.
3. **Scalability**: Custom solutions can be designed with scalability in mind, allowing for future growth and expansion without significant redesign or reimplementation.
4. **Competitive Advantage**: Custom-built solutions can provide a competitive edge by offering unique features or capabilities not available in off-the-shelf products.
5. **Ownership**: Users own the intellectual property rights to custom-built solutions, providing more control over the software's future direction and evolution.

Cons:
1. **Higher Costs**: Custom development can be more expensive upfront due to the need for design, development, and testing from scratch.
2. **Time-Consuming**: Developing custom solutions takes time, especially for complex or large-scale projects, delaying time-to-market.
3. **Maintenance and Support**: Users are responsible for maintaining and supporting custom-built solutions, which can be resource-intensive and require specialized expertise.
4. **Potential for Over-Engineering**: Custom solutions may be over-engineered, including unnecessary features or complexity that adds development time and cost.
5. **Risk of Project Failure**: Custom development projects carry inherent risks, including scope creep, budget overruns, and technical challenges, which can lead to project failure if not managed effectively.

# what is CAM,CIM,CAD:
## CAM(Computer-aided manufacturing)
*DEFINATION:`The use of software to control machine tools and automate manufacturing processes.`
*CAM has evolved to be an essential tool in various industries such as aerospace and automotive, offering benefits like increased machining accuracy, faster job completion, material and tool savings, and digital review through simulation checks
*The software calculates optimal tool motion for specific parts and toolpaths, reducing manual programming time while improving precision.
