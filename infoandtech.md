# introduction to computers üñ•Ô∏è
* Computer is an electronic device, which accepts the data and
instructions (input) from the user, process the data according to
the instructions and gives the result (output).

## Characteristics of compuetrs üñ•Ô∏è
* the characteristices of a computer are based on few things given below:
* ` speed `
* ` accuracy `
* ` storage `
* ` powwer of remembering `
* ` Versatility`
* ` No I Q (Intelligence Quotient)`
* ` reliability `
* ` communication `

|Consists of objects that can be `touched and observed`|software exists only in `digital form `and is accessed via a `user interface`|
|hardware components may need to be repaired or replaced due to damage or obsolescence|Not subject to physical deterioration, but may become obsolete or incompatible with newer hardware|
|Not susceptible to viruses or malicious software|vulnerable to viruses and other forms of malicious software|

  # types of computers 
  * `micro computers`: A microcomputer is a small computer typically equipped with a microprocessor, especially known as a personal computer. These devices are compact and commonly used for personal or small-scale computing tasks.
* `mini computers`: A minicomputer is a type of computer that retains most features and capabilities of a large computer but is smaller in physical size, offering a balance between mainframes and personal computers.
* `main computers`: A mainframe computer, also known as a mainframe or big iron, is a powerful computer primarily utilized by large organizations for critical applications such as bulk data processing, industry statistics, enterprise resource planning, and transaction processing. Mainframes are distinguished by their significant processing power, larger size than personal computers, and capability to handle very high volumes of input and output. These computers are designed to support multiple users simultaneously and are often used as servers in data centers.
